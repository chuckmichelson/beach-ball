# ouija-bored

This project is attempting to better understand how groups of people make decisions collectively online.
I chose a Ouija board as a starting point because it is an intimate activity and has no right answer.
I want to explore how people feel when controlling a cursor collectively.

Later, I intend to extend this idea to other games besides Ouija board, such as pong, brick breaker,
and Pac-Man.

The code is a heavily modified version of a multiplayer snake game
https://github.com/HungryTurtleCode/multiplayerSnake. The author has an awesome YouTube video explaining
everything, and also has a followup video for how to deploy the project to Netlify / Heroku. Here are
the videos:

You can try out the Ouija board here: https://www.ouija-bored.com

It's not a full game yet but some basic functionality is there.
