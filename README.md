# beach-ball

This project is meant to be a jumping off point for creating multiplayer games. It's a node.js app that
uses socket.io and some simple game physics. Players can enter their initials to join the
game, and then use a virtual joystick to control their avatar and bounce a beach ball around.

<p>The code is a heavily modified version of a multiplayer snake game

<p>The author has an awesome YouTube video explaining
everything, and also has a followup video for how to deploy the project to Netlify / Heroku. Here are
the videos:
